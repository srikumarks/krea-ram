A medley of problems, taken from a number of other math circles.

= Problems

+ Let $p$ and $q$ be prime numbers and $n$ be a whole number such that
  $ 1/p + 1/q + 1/(p q) = 1/n $. Find all possible sets of values for $p$,
  $q$ and $n$.

+ The increasing sequence $1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13$ consists of all those
  positive integers which are powers of 3 or sums of distinct powers of 3
  (including $3^0$). Find the $100^"th"$ term of the sequence.

+ Assume that $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are positive integers such that $a^5 = b^4$,
  $c^3 = d^2$, and $c - a = 19$. Find $d - b$.

+ Suppose that points $A$, $B$, $C$ are vertices of a scalene triangle. How
  many points $D$ in the plane of $Delta A B C$ have the property that the
  quadrilateral $A B C D$ has at least one axis of symmetry?

+ By a proper divisor of a natural number we mean a positive integral divisor
  other than 1 and the number itself. A natural number greater than 1 will be
  called nice if it is equal to the product of its distinct proper divisors. What
  is the sum of the first ten nice numbers?

+ A beaker filled to the brim with water weighs 500 grams, while the same beaker
  filled halfway weights 325 grams. How many grams of water can the beaker hold?

+ A train moves in one direction for 5.5 hours. If the train covers *any* 100 km
  segment in 1 hour: (a) Is the train necessarily moving at a constant rate?
  (b) Is the train's average speed necessarily 100 kmph?

+ Let n be a positive integer. Show that the set of weights $ 1,3,3^2,3^3,3^4,... $
  can be used to weigh an $n$-gram weight (using both pans of the scale). Show that
  this can be done in exactly one way.

+ How many terminal zeroes are there if you expand $1000!$ completely. $ 1000!
  = 1 times 2 times 3 times ... times 1000 $.

+ Does there exist a triangle such that the sum of two of its altitudes is larger than
  the sum of the two corresponding bases?
