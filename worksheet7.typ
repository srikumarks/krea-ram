Some problems taken from Russian math circle problem set.

= Problems

+ Which number is greater: $31^11$ or $17^14$?

+ Show that $2^100 + 3^100 < 4^100$

+ Prove that $ 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/4 - 1/5 ... -1/99 + 1/100 > 1/5 $

+ Which number is greater: $1234567 times 1234569$ or $1234568^2$?

+ How many ways are there to rearrange the letters in "ASUNDER" so that
  the vowels will be in alphabetical order, as well as consonants? 
  Example: "DANERUS" is one way since A-E-U and D-N-R-S appear in order.

+ Find the remainder when $3^102$ is divided by $101$.

+ Given that $p$, $p+10$ and $p+14$ are prime numbers, find $p$.

+ Given the pair of prime numbers $p$ and $8p^2+1$, find $p$.

+ Prove that there are no natural numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^2 - 3 b^2 = 8$.

+ In an $8 times 8$ table one of the boxes is colored black and all the others
  are white. Prove that one cannot make all the boxes white by "recolouring" the
  rows and columns. "Recolouring" is the operation of changing the color of all
  the boxes in a row or column. Is that true for a $3 times 3$ table also?
